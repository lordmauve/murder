THEY: Ah, hello. Do you have my gin and tonic?


[Kitty Morgan]?
YOU: Do you know Kitty Morgan?
THEY:
   Ah, yes. The name rings a bell. I can't recall where from.

   Anything else?


[Buster Baines]

LEARN: Cards

[About Buster Baines] if .KnowsBB

LEARN: Texan
LEARN: Hotel


[Doctor Manx]

THEY: Other than pleasantries at the bar, no.


[Mrs. Manx]
YOU: What can you tell me about Mrs. Manx?

      Honestly, it's keeping me awake at night.
LEARN: Snoring


[Last Seen] if .KnowsBB
YOU: When was the last time you saw Mr. Baines?
THEY: I saw him here at... say, around six-fifteen.

   He ordered a martini -- I remember that because it looked pretty darned
   delicious. So I ordered one too!


[Cards]?
YOU: You play cards?
THEY: I'm a sucker for a game of poker, I'm afraid.


[KM]?
YOU: Do you know who KM might be?
THEY: Hmm... KM... there's a great cocktail called a "Kicking Mickey".

      It's gin, brandy and bitters, if I recall.
YOU: Thats... not what I'm looking for.
THEY: Ok, that makes one of us.


[Statue]? if .KnowsBB
YOU: Do you know the significance of this statue? It belonged to Mr. Baines.
THEY: I've... never seen it before.


[Statue]? if .KnowsBB, Cheshire owned statue
YOU: I understand this statue is actually yours.

     But I found it in Baines' luggage.
THEY: It... Blast.

      It *was* mine. Look, I had a bit of a loss at cards. I wagered it, and
      Baines won it.
THEY: I didn't have a hand in his death, though, let me reassure you of that.

      I lost it fair and square and I don't welch on my wagers!
THEY: Here, take my room key -- I signed a Bill of Sale to Baines. It's needed
      for the provenance. You can find a copy of it in my room.
LEARN: Cheshire's Cabin


[What is the statue?] if Cheshire's Cabin
YOU: What is this statue?
THEY: It's an antique Egyptian statue of some sort. It's been in my possession
      for years.

      Got it at an auction, if I recall correctly.

      Actually -- if I recall correctly, I bought it to impress a girl I knew
      at the time who was into archeology.
YOU: So you don't know its historical value?
THEY: No --

      Oh! She was a Persian Longhair. Jessica. Or was that Margaret?


[Why did you have the statue?] if Cheshire's Cabin
YOU: Why did you bring the statue on this trip?
THEY: It was going to be a gift, to an Oriental businessman I'm meeting in New
      York.

      I have a business venture, you see -- we're planning to sell them
      telephony equipment, actually -- and apparently a gift is the fashion
      among the Nipponese.
THEY: It's devastating to have lost it. I mean, it's not the expense -- though
      that does pinch, it's true: the thing was worth a fortune.

      But no, I imagine the deal will fall through now. That's the rub!
