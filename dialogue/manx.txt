LEARN: .knowsBB


[Buster Baines] if .knowsBB

      knew him... well.


[Katerina la Gata]?
YOU: What can you tell me about the artist, Señorita la Gata?
THEY: We had quite a pleasant conversation at dinner last night.

      We talked about art, and the history of art, and why people started
      to create art in the first place.

      She's a fascinating woman.


[Last Seen] if .knowsBB
YOU: When did you last see Mr Baines?
THEY: Last night? Or perhaps the night before.
LEARN: Manx didn't see Baines


[Last Seen] if Mrs Manx saw Baines, Manx didn't see Baines
YOU: Sir, your wife says she saw Baines here.
THEY: I'm sorry, then; perhaps I was not paying attention.


[KM]?
YOU: Have you any idea who KM might be?
THEY: I am KM! Karl Manx!
YOU: Have you seen this note?
THEY: "I must see you again!"? This is... I don't believe this is addressed
      to me.


[Note] if Kitty Morgan
YOU: I think this note might be addressed to you?
THEY: "I must see you again!"? You are mistaken, sir. This is not to me.
YOU: Ah, then I know who it is addressed to.


[Doctor] if .knowsBB
YOU: I understand you're a doctor?

     Perhaps you could take a look at the victim.
THEY: Ha, ha, ha!

      I'm not a medical doctor! I'm a Doctor of Anthropology.
LEARN: Anthropology


[Kitty Morgan]?
YOU: Do you know Kitty Morgan?
THEY: Never heard of her. Should I have?


[Lord Cheshire]?
YOU: What can you tell me about Lord Cheshire?
THEY: He always seems to be in here, usually with a drink in his hand.

      that kind of thing myself.


[Anthropology?] if Anthropology
YOU: What is anthropology?
THEY: From the Greek "anthropos", meaning man. I study humanity.


[Egyptology] if Anthropology, Manx is an egyptologist
YOU: Someone told me you're an Egyptologist?
THEY: No, I'm an *Anthropologist*.

      Egypt is just my current speciality. I've been writing a paper on belief
      systems in ancient Egypt.
LEARN: .speciality


[Snoring]?
YOU: Sir, some of the guests are complaining about your snoring.
THEY: Nothing to be done about that, I'm afraid.

      I've been a snorer for years.
LEARN: Long-time snorer


[Statue]?
YOU: Have you seen this statue?
THEY: Where did you get this? I've not seen it.

      I... know nothing about it.

      Perhaps I could take a closer look?
YOU: I'm afraid it may be a clue to the reason behind Baines' death.

     Perhaps you'll be able to see it when I've got to the bottom of this.


[Statue]? if .speciality
YOU: So you do know what this statue is?
THEY: It's Bastet, of course. Egyptian goddess. This is an original idol, from
      the early second dynasty!
THEY: Perhaps I could hold onto it for a more detailed study?
YOU: I think I'll keep it for now.
THEY: I'd be very keen to see it again later. Very keen.
LEARN: .bastet


[Archeological theory]? if .bastet, .speciality
YOU: What do you think about Cohen's theory that ancient Egyptians worshipped
     humans?
THEY: That is *my* theory! Cohen is trying to cash in on my big idea, with all
      this press and expeditions.

      It's *my* lifetime's work and I will not see him swoop in and steal the
      glory!
LEARN: .dedicated


[Dedication] if .dedicated

THEY: I don't know what you're talking about, sir.
YOU: She told you there was an important Egyptian artifact on board.
THEY: I don't recall any such conversation.
YOU: She hoped that you'd "acquire" it, and she might then take it off you,
     seeing you as an easier mark than Mr. Baines.
THEY: Preposterous!
LEARN: Manx accused


[Bye]
YOU: Thank you for your time.
THEY: That's quite all right.
