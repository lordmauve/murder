THEY:
   Ah, Billy.

   I'm afraid we have a situation: Mr Baines has been found
   dead. We think he's been poisoned.
YOU:
   Poisoned, sir?

   Wait, why did you send for me?
THEY:
   Billy, this is a sensitive situation. A death... a poisoning
   on board? The guests will be terrified.

   I've radioed it in, but we're five days out of New York; I'd
   like some answers as soon as possible.
THEY:
   You're the only person we can spare to look into this. I don't
   want to take anybody else off duty: everyone else has a role
   to play in keeping the guests calm.
LEARN: .death


[enter] if .death
THEY: How's the investigation going?


[Mr Baines]
YOU: Mr. Baines?
THEY:
   A Mr. Buster Baines.

   This is his cabin, number thirty-five.

   I know it's gruesome, but I'd like you to take a look in case there's
   anything we missed.
LEARN: Buster Baines


[Poison]
YOU: How do we know he's been poisoned?
THEY:
   Well, to put it indelicately, the man is lying dead in a
   pool of vomit.

   We all eat the same food at dinner, yet nobody else on board is
   ill, so we can assume Chef's food is not to blame.

   And anyway, I'd want someone to investigate a suspicious
   death regardless.


[KM] if Note
YOU: I found a note that may be from Buster Baines.

   Do you know who "KM" might be?
THEY: Hmm... let me consult the manifest.

   There are two passengers on board with those initials... Dr. Karl Manx,
   and Ms. Kitty Morgan.
THEY: Dr. Manx's cabin is number 36.

   Ms. Morgan's is... number 46.
LEARN: Kitty Morgan


[I know what happened] if Manx accused, Kibble accused, Kibble gave Mrs Manx pills
YOU: I know what happened.
THEY: Then I'll gather everyone in the lounge to hear it.
EXEC: start_ending()
EXIT:


[Bye] if Buster Baines
THEY: If you find anything, please report to me.

   I'll be on the bridge.
YOU: Aye-aye, sir.
EXIT:


[Bye] if Lift
YOU: Thank you, captain.
