THEY:
   Ah, Billy.

   I'm afraid we have a situation: Mr Baines has been found
   dead. We think he's been poisoned.
YOU:
   Poisoned, sir?

   Wait, why did you send for me?
THEY:
   Billy, this is a sensitive situation. A death... a poisoning
   on board? The guests will be terrified.

   I've radioed it in, but we're five days out of New York; I'd
   like some answers as soon as possible.
THEY:
   You're the only person we can spare to look into this. I don't
   want to take anybody else off duty: everyone else has a role
   to play in keeping the guests calm.
LEARN: .death


[enter] if .death
THEY: How's the investigation going?


[Mr Baines]
YOU: Mr. Baines?
THEY:
   A Mr. Buster Baines.

   He's apparently a Texan - some hotel magnate.

   This is his cabin, number thirty-five.
LEARN: Buster Baines


[Poison]
YOU: How do we know he's been poisoned?
THEY:
   Well, to put it indelicately, the man is lying dead in a
   pool of vomit.

   We all eat the same food at dinner, yet nobody else on board is
   ill, so we can assume Chef's food is not to blame.

   And anyway, I'd want someone to investigate a suspicious
   death regardless.


[Bye] if Buster Baines
THEY: If you find anything, please report to me.
YOU: Aye-aye, sir.
