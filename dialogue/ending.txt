THEY: Thanks for coming.

      Billy here would like to let us know what happened in the matter of
      Mr. Baines' untimely death.

      Billy, please, go on.
EXEC: billy.image = 'billy-standing-l'
YOU: Buster Baines was murdered by people on this ship.

     The reason involves love, money, and reputation.

YOU: Buster Baines fell in love with a woman on board this ship, Kitty Morgan.

     Little did he know that one of the crew members, Donnie Kibble, also had
     affections for Ms. Morgan.

     While smoking, Mr. Kibble found a note that Mr. Baines had tried to pass
     to Ms. Morgan, and he decided to act.

YOU: Earlier, in a game of cards, Lord Cheshire had staked an extremely
     expensive Egyptian antiquity, which he thereby lost to victim, Mr. Baines.

YOU: Few others knew this, but Calico Croker, the housekeeper, learning of the
     statue and its sale, cunningly let this "slip" in a conversation in Mr.
     and Mrs. Manx's room, believing this would create the opportunity to
     steal it herself.

YOU: Manx, an anthropologist spcialising in Ancient Egypt, had become so
     determined to out-do a rival, that he attempted to obtain the statue,
     without considering the cost to Baines.

YOU: The means for both crimes was provided coincidentally by Mrs. Manx,
     who asked Donnie Kibble to find her some sleeping pills from the ship's
     stores.

YOU: Mr. Manx slipped a pill into Baines' food at dinner tonight.

     And Mr. Kibble dissolved one in a drink he served him.
YOU: I don't believe either man had motive enough to kill Mr. Baines.

     Kibble drugged Baines so he could make moves on Ms. Morgan.

     Manx drugged Baines so he could search for the Bastet idol amongst
     Baines' possessions.
YOU: It was the unfortunate collision of both of these plots that gave
     Baines the overdose that killed him.

THEY: Astonishing. I just need to know one thing, Billy. How would you
      apportion blame? Which was the greater of the two evils?


[Manx]
YOU: An erudite man, Mr. Karl Manx was enraged about his rival's discoveries
     and recognition, and his act was cold-blooded.
YOU: Kibble's act, by contrast, was motivated by passion -- and while we cannot
     forgive Kibble, we can perhaps sympathise with his motives.
YOU: Mr. Karl Manx's crime was worse.
EXEC: game_over('Manx')
EXIT:


[Kibble]
YOU: Mr. Donnie Kibble drugged, and thereby killed, an innocent man for no
     other reason than to pursue a lady.
YOU: Manx's act, was heinous, but done in pursuit of knowledge.

     We should not forget he was exploited by Croker in hope of her own gain.
YOU: Mr. Kibble's crime was worse.
EXEC: game_over('Kibble')
EXIT:


[Neither]
YOU: Neither crime is any worse than the other.

     Baines would still be alive today if neither had acted.

     Though neither knew of the other's plot, they must both be treated as
     conspirators in the murder.
